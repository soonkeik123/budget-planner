# Budget-Planner

This Budget Planner app is my first project created using the Angular framework. It is generated with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) and primarily uses TypeScript, HTML, and SCSS. Through this project, I have learned how to create page routing, forms, and how to interact between the HTML interface and TypeScript logic.


## Features

- **Page Routing**: Easily navigate between different pages of the application.
- **Forms**: Collect and validate user input efficiently.
- **Data Interaction**: Smooth interaction between the HTML interface and TypeScript logic.
- **Side Navigation**: A side navigation panel that can slide in and out, allowing users to easily route to other pages.

## Pages

1. **Login**: User authentication page.
2. **Dashboard**: Overview of the user's budget and expenses.
3. **Income**: Page to track and manage income sources.
4. **Expense**: Page to track and manage expenses.
5. **To-Do Transactions**: Manage upcoming transactions.
6. **Profile**: User profile management.
7. **Transaction History**: View and manage past transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: Framework for building the web application.
- **TypeScript**: Primary language used for development.
- **HTML**: Markup language for creating the application's structure.
- **SCSS**: CSS preprocessor used for styling the application.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
